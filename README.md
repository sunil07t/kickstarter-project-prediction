# kickstarter-project-prediction
Kickstarter is a platform that provides crowdfunding to projects. In this research, we implement and test different types of models to predict whether or not a project will succeed on Kickstarter. We analyze the data available on the Kaggle dataset and perform feature engineering to extract important features for the models. Then we apply and compare the scores of various machine learning techniques. Results show that Light Gradient Boosting Machine outperforms other techniques in accuracy, a model without numbers of backers as a feature drastically decreases the accuracy and building models per category have better accuracy for some category.
